# api_web_service

This application provides a basic environment that can be extended to develope a Ruby on Rails API web service.
An authentication layer is implemented and it is based on [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and [devise_token_auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth).
If you need to restrict access to actions of specific controller, it should extends RestrictedController.
To access to restricted actions the header resquest must includes the the following parameters
  - access-token
  - uid
  - client

plus ```application/json``` as Content-type.

You can find the relatives value in the response header after performing the login through a POST request to /auth/sign_in
with parameters
```{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password"}``` plus ```application/json``` as Content-type.

### Installation

Clone the repository and create your own ```config/database.yml``` and ```config/secrets.yml```
```
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails s
```
### Production

Remember to propertly configure the app editing ```config/initializer/devise_token_auth.rb``` and ```config/application.rb``` at the line:
```
config.middleware.use Rack::Cors do
    # Your configurations
end
```
as suggested [here](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth#cors). You should consider to use [j-toker](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/j-toker) to perform your requests and [Apipie](https://github.com/Apipie/apipie-rails) to document your APIs.
